This species as well as other wasps of the genera <i>Vespula<\/i> <br\/>and <i>Dolichovespula<\/i> are known in the United States as yellowjackets.  Their natural habitat is dry grasslands <br\/>and woodlands, but they easily adapt to urban habitats.   As in other vespids species, <i>V. vulgaris<\/i> queens <br\/>are the only member of a hive to survive through the winter, and in the spring each begins to build a paper nest in <br\/>a hidden cavity, often subterranean, such as an animal burrow, tree stump, or crevice in rocks or walls to start <br\/>a new colony.  The queen cares for the first brood of larva, which quickly hatch into workers and take over the task <br\/>of building and protecting the nest and caring for young.  Workers live 2-4 weeks, and are replaced by subsequent <br\/>generations throughout the summer.   <br\/> <br\/>Yellowjacket workers are predators on a wide variety of small <br\/>insects.  For this reason they can be very helpful in removing insect species that are pests of ornamental and crop <br\/>plants, but they also can significantly affect populations of native insects (this is especially documented <br\/>in New Zealand, where <i>V. vulgaris<\/i> is a significant pest species).  Yellowjackets are hazards to beehives <br\/>and cause significant financial loss in apiaries where they destroy the hives.  In addition to preying on live <br\/>insects, yellowjackets (as are most vespid wasps) are notorious scavengers, and will eat dead meat.  They masticate <br\/>all meat\/insect prey and bring it back to the nest as food for their developing larvae.  Adult workers themselves <br\/>use honeydew and nectar as food sources.  Because they consume large quantities they compete with other pollinators <br\/>of many types, sometimes seriously disrupting natural ecosystems.  Although they have stingers for defense, <br\/>common wasps kill their prey by biting them rather than stinging.   Foraging workers become a common, hazardous <br\/>pest in mid-summer, as they scavenge around humans, eating sugary drinks and meats at picnics or from garbage <br\/>cans.  <i>Vespula vulgaris<\/i> can sting multiple times, and are fairly aggressive.  <i>Vespula vulgaris<\/i> <br\/>can be readily captured and killed in a variety of commercial and home-made traps baited with food or with synthetic <br\/>chemicals attractive to wasps, to reduce numbers around inhabited areas.  Insecticides can also be applied to <br\/>kill nests.   <br\/> <br\/>(<a href=\u0022www.cals.uidaho.edu\/edcomm\/pdf\/BUL\/BUL0852.pdf\u0022>Bechinski et al. 2009<\/a>; <br\/> <a href=\u0022http:\/\/www.cabi.org\/isc\/?compid=5&amp;dsid=56675&amp;loadmodule=datasheet&amp;page=481&amp;site=144\u0022>CABI <br\/>2011<\/a>; <a href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Vespula_vulgaris&amp;oldid=454211255\u0022>Wikipedia <br\/>2011<\/a>) "},"flathierarchy":[{"sourceIdentifier":"9679364","taxonID":47735204,"parentNameUsageID":47735201,"taxonConceptID":1032844,"scientificName":"Vespula vulgaris (Linnaeus, 1758)","taxonRank":"Species","type":"leaf"}],"preferredCommonNames":{"vernacularName":"Common Wasp","language":"en","eol_preferred":true},"commonNames":[{"vernacularName":"Gemeine wespe","language":"de","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Common Wasp","language":"en","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"A Yellow-jacket","language":"en"},{"vernacularName":"Common yellowjacket","language":"en"}],"image":{"objectId":"66d36e1d1211b06aef654b15cf16695b","identifier":"66d36e1d1211b06aef654b15cf16695b","title":"Common Yellowjacket Queen","licence":"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/2.0\/","rights":null,"credits":"<a href='http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/25449831@N00'>Sean McCann<\/a>&copy; ","description":null,"mimeType":"jpg","fileName":"66d36e1d1211b06aef654b15cf16695b.jpg","URL":"http:\/\/media.eol.org\/content\/2011\/11\/02\/15\/57851_orig.jpg"}},"48130068":{"collectionid":29656,"pageid":328025,"taxonConceptId":48130068,"taxonName":"Castor canadensis","textDesc":{"objectId":"23103411472571e5f96fdee8475cbe29","identifier":"23103411472571e5f96fdee8475cbe29","title":"Description","licence":"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/3.0\/","rights":null,"credits":"&copy; Smithsonian Institution","description":"The largest North American rodent and the only one with a broad, flat, scaly tail, the Beaver is now common and widespread, <br\/>even in areas it did not inhabit during pre-colonial times.

The bee ranges from 3\/8 to 3\/4 of an inch long, with workers being the smallest <br\/>and the queen being the largest. A queen bee is elongate and has a straight stinger with no barbs. A worker bee has <br\/>hind legs specialized for collecting pollen - each leg is flattened and covered with long fringed hairs that form <br\/>a pollen basket. A worker bee's stinger has barbs. A drone bee is stout-bodied and has large eyes. <br\/> <br\/>Wild <br\/>European honey bee nests are found in hollow trees or man-made structures. Managed colonies are often kept in <br\/>wooden hives. Flowers in meadows, open woods, agricultural areas, and yards and gardens are visited by worker <br\/>bees.

Physical field marks <br\/>include a green-gray body, white eye ring, pale breast, thin bill, and white wing bars. Male and female Acadian <br\/>Flycatchers are similar to one another in all seasons. The Acadian Flycatcher is a more southerly breeder than <br\/>most of its relatives, being found in summer in extreme southern Canada and across much of the eastern United States <br\/>from New York south to Florida and west to Texas. Least Flycatchers spend the winter in Central and South America, <br\/>although identifying this species\u2019 in much of its winter range is difficult due to its similarity to other related <br\/>species. Acadian Flycatchers breed in mature deciduous forests and, in parts of the southeastern U.S., in swamp <br\/>forests dominated by bald cypress. On migration, this species enters younger, more open woodland and forest <br\/>edges. In winter, Acadian Flycatchers inhabit humid tropical forests. This species primarily eats insects. <br\/>In northern forests in summer, Acadian Flycatchers are most likely to be seen perching in the forest canopy while <br\/>gleaning insects from leaves. Even when active, however, the Acadian Flycatcher is a difficult bird to identify. <br\/>Learning this species\u2019 song is crucial to separating it from its relatives, and silent birds are frequently <br\/>impossible to identify in areas with multiple Empidonax species.

Maybe found  in shallower depths than A. ocellaris.  Associated with the anemones: <br\/> Heteractis crispa, Heteractis magnifica, and Stichodactyla gigantea (Ref. 5911).  This species has been reared <br\/>in captivity (Ref. 35404, 35413, 35420).

","description":"The eastern tent caterpillar (<i>Malacosoma americanum<\/i>) is a moth species native to forests of North America. <br\/> It is at the caterpillar stage that the average person would happen along this species.  The caterpillars are social, <br\/>and in the early spring a cohort of newly hatched caterpillars (typically between 50-200 individuals) build <br\/>a silk tent together, in which they live during their larval phase.  As they grow in size, the caterpillars continuously <br\/>expand the tent, and these conspicuous silky structures are easily viewable in crooks of tree branches in the <br\/>spring.  Caterpillars feed together three times a day, at dawn, evening, and night, following silk threads that <br\/>they spin from their tent to distant feeding sites, and then return en masse along these silk trails to rest in their <br\/>nest before feeding again.  Caterpillars also release pheromones to mark trails directing the colony to good <br\/>feeding sites. Their preferred host plants are cherry, apple and rose species but they are also commonly found <br\/>on other broad-leaf trees and shrubs, such as ash, birch, will, maple, oak and poplar.  Adults are small, grey and <br\/>inconspicuous moths, and do not feed.  A colony of Eastern tent caterpillars can quickly defoliate small ornamental <br\/>trees, but trees usually recover with a new growth of leaves later in the year, since the species is univoltine <br\/>(only has one generation per year).  Populations fluctuate from year to year and bloom in outbreak numbers every <br\/>several years.  Heavy <i>M. americanum <\/i>infestations can cause serious damage to larger trees.  Eastern tent <br\/>caterpillars are considered a pest for aesthetic reasons, and also a major pest to apple orchards, where it is <br\/>the subject of pest-management systems.  Eastern tent caterpillar is not effectively controlled by pesticides. <br\/> Natural enemies are important to managing population numbers, and mechanical removal of nests can greatly reduce <br\/>the problem.   <br\/> <br\/>Although the exact cause is still unclear, <i>Malacosoma americanum<\/i> caterpillars <br\/>are believed responsible for Mare Reproductive Loss Syndrome (MRLS), a syndrome in which mares exposed to eastern <br\/>tent caterpillars show increased incidence of fetal loss.<br><br> <br\/>(Sebastian et al. 2008; <a href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Eastern_tent_caterpillar&amp;oldid=450777196\u0022> <br\/>Wikipedia 2011<\/a>) <br\/> <br\/> "},"flathierarchy":[{"sourceIdentifier":"10645994","taxonID":47934604,"parentNameUsageID":47934601,"taxonConceptID":381885,"scientificName":"Malacosoma americana Fabricius 1793","taxonRank":"Species","type":"leaf"}],"preferredCommonNames":{"vernacularName":"Eastern Tent Caterpillar Moth","language":"en","eol_preferred":true},"commonNames":[{"vernacularName":"Amerikanischer ringelspinner","language":"de","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Eastern Tent Caterpillar Moth","language":"en","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"eastern tent caterpillar","language":"en"},{"vernacularName":"eastern tent caterpillars","language":"en"},{"vernacularName":"livr\u00e9e d'Am\u00e9rique","language":"fr","eol_preferred":true}],"image":{"objectId":"3a911b5ff6699bac218dec0ad052ea38","identifier":"3a911b5ff6699bac218dec0ad052ea38","title":"Eastern Tent Caterpillar, Malacosoma americanum","licence":"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc\/2.0\/","rights":null,"credits":"<a href='http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/25980517@N03'>Lynette Schimming<\/a>&copy; ","description":null,"mimeType":"jpg","fileName":"3a911b5ff6699bac218dec0ad052ea38.jpg","URL":"http:\/\/media.eol.org\/content\/2011\/12\/09\/00\/33788_orig.jpg"}}}
