They travel <br\/>long distances to stay with pack ice, and fast for long periods of time if food is not available. In Hudson Bay, the <br\/>ice melts by late July and the bears fast until November, when it freezes again. They do not drink water or urinate <br\/>the whole time. Pregnant females, who enter dens to give birth, continue fasting for another four months, living <br\/>only on stored fat for eight months. Cubs are born in December, and are ready to follow their mother out of the den <br\/>and learn to hunt by March or April.

Sheltering by day in dense bush or a den such as an underground burrow or a hollow log, the Tasmanian <br\/>devil emerges at night to search for food. It has a slightly clumsy, loping gait, but can cover considerable ground <br\/>(up to 16 kilometres) in a single night (1) (2) (3). While capable of hunting small prey, scavenging is its forte, <br\/>with an acute sense of smell enabling it to rapidly locate dead animals in the bush (3) (4) (6). Typically it will <br\/>wholly devour whatever meat is available, from insects to beached fish, with small mammals such as possums, wombats <br\/>and wallabies being particular favourites (2) (3) (4). It is not uncommon for several devils to arrive at one carcass <br\/>at the same time, precipitating the noisy displays of aggression necessary to establish a hierarchy of dominance <br\/>(3) (4) (6).&nbsp;The Tasmanian devil is a solitary animal, but at times is also highly social, such as when feeding <br\/>communally, or during the breeding season (4) (5). Mating usually occurs over a short, intense period in March, <br\/>but can continue into July (3) (4). The female exhibits little in the way of fidelity, visiting several males in <br\/>quick succession, whilst each male, uncertain of their own paternity, will try to physically prevent the promiscuous <br\/>female from leaving (5). After a three week gestation period, the female gives birth to two to four young that immediately <br\/>attach to one of four teats in the backward-opening pouch. At around five months old, the fully-furred young emerge <br\/>from the pouch and take up residence in a simple, grass-lined den. Another month on, and they start to explore the <br\/>den's surroundings, eventually becoming fully weaned and independent at about ten months old (2) (3) (4). Sexual <br\/>maturity is reached towards the end of the second year, with an average life expectancy of around five to six years <br\/>in the wild (1) (2) (3).

Spotted hyenas live in clans and frequently hunt in groups, as cooperation can improve their <br\/>hunting success.  However, this often depends on prey availability; in the Ngorongoro Crate, large groups are <br\/>required to kill a zebra, whilst in the southern Kalahari, gemsbok calves are the primary prey, for which a single <br\/>hyena will suffice (2).  Even when moving alone, spotted hyenas keep in touch with other members of their clan with <br\/>whoops, yells and a manic cackle, which gave rise to their name 'laughing hyena' (2).  Spotted hyenas eat with incredible <br\/>speed, consuming everything except horns; a group of hyenas was observed demolishing an adult zebra in just 15 <br\/>minutes (4).&nbsp;Each hyena clan occupies a territory and defends it against neighbouring clans.  Female spotted <br\/>hyenas, which are more aggressive than males (5), are the dominant sex. The clan is structured by a strict hierarchy <br\/>where the highest ranking male is subordinate to the lowest ranking female (2) (4).  The alpha female is the best <br\/>fed in the clan (3).  When around two and a half years of age, males leave the clan they were born in and work their way <br\/>into a new clan, whereas females usually remain with the same clan for life (2) (4).&nbsp;Mature females usually <br\/>give birth to one or two cubs a year, after a gestation period of 110 days (6).  Males play no parental role to the cubs <br\/>(3), which are born in dens with a set of teeth and their eyes already open.  Within minutes of birth they can engage <br\/>in aggressive interactions, which quickly lead to the establishment of a dominance hierarchy, with the dominant <br\/>cub getting to control access to the mother's milk (2).  Sometimes this aggression can lead to the death of the weaker <br\/>cub (4) (7).  The cubs are fed meat at nine months, leave the den at 9 to 12 months, but are not weaned until they are <br\/>12 to 16 months (8).

Males range from 300 to 600 <br\/>pounds, and females typically weigh 200 to 400 pounds. While some grizzlies have fur that looks frosted (hence, <br\/>\u0022grizzly\u0022), their thick fur varies in color from light brown to nearly black. Distinguishing a grizzly from a <br\/>black bear can be very difficult despite the grizzly's larger size, and shorter, rounder ears. <br\/> <br\/>As <br\/>an omnivore, the grizzly bear eats both plants and animals. Approximately 80 to 90 percent of its diet is green <br\/>vegetation, nuts, seeds, berries, and roots. Grizzlies also eat insects, and they often leave behind overturned <br\/>stones and rotted logs. Most of the meat in the diet comes from animal carcasses, though the grizzly will occasionally <br\/>prey on elk. In Alaska and Canada, salmon is an important food source. In the Greater Yellowstone and Northern <br\/>Rockies regions, grizzlies will feed predominantly on whitebark pine seeds if given a large enough source. <br\/> <br\/><br\/>In the early 1800s, an estimated 50,000 grizzly bears roamed across the western United States from the Great <br\/>Plains to the Pacific coast. Today, their populations in the lower 48 states are limited to the Northern Cascades <br\/>(Washington), Northern Rockies, and Greater Yellowstone Ecosystems. <br\/> <br\/>Under the Endangered Species <br\/>Act, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the grizzly bear as threatened in the lower 48 states in 1975. Recovery <br\/>efforts have been modestly successful in some regions. In November 2005, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced <br\/>its intent to establish the Greater Yellowstone grizzly bear population as a \u0022distinct population segment (DPS)\u0022 <br\/>and to remove this DPS from the List of Threatened and Endangered Wildlife.
