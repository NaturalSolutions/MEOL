During this time, pandas signal their presence by marking trees and banks with scent <br\/>secreted from glands located beneath the tail (6). They will also strip bark and occasionally males will dust <br\/>bathe; dust particles become covered with the pandas' scent and then waft into the air (6). Males also call during <br\/>this time, and these can be heard echoing through the mountains (7). Females give birth to a single cub that is born <br\/>in an extremely immature stage of development; weighing only a tiny fraction (0.001%) of their mother's weight <br\/>(5). The female cares for her cub in a den located in the base of a hollow tree or in a cave for the first few months of <br\/>its life (4) (8). Young pandas remain dependent on their mother for a year, by which time they are weaned, but usually <br\/>remain with their mothers until they are two years of age and sometimes longer (4) (8). During this time, females <br\/>may leave their cubs to forage for days at a time and in the past these supposedly 'abandoned' cubs were taken into <br\/>captivity (4).&nbsp;Pandas are unusual amongst the larger mammals for the extreme specialisation of their <br\/>diet, which depends almost entirely on bamboo. Bamboo is a relatively abundant food source but has poor nutritional <br\/>value; adults must spend around 14 hours a day feeding (4), and need to consume between 10 and 20 kg over 24 hours <br\/>(8). They therefore alternate periods of feeding and resting throughout the day and night (7). Bamboo is evergreen <br\/>and in winter pandas concentrate on leaves and stems, descending to lower altitudes in search of new shoots in <br\/>spring (6). Despite their specialisation on bamboo, pandas will readily scavenge on meat should they come across <br\/>it (7).

Much of a koala's time is spent sleeping, and when <br\/>awake they are still a fairly sedentary species. An adult consumes about 500g of fresh leaves per day (3). Koalas <br\/>feed on a variety of trees, but the bulk of their diet comes from only a few eucalypt species (6), with marked local <br\/>and regional differences for the species of eucalypts preferred (5). Eucalyptus leaves are very fibrous and <br\/>highly toxic, but koalas have evolved to cope with these problems with special cheek teeth that grind the leaves <br\/>into a fine paste, which is then digested by microbes in the caecum part of the intestine which is unusually long, <br\/>at around 200cm, and has a blind end, unlike the caecum in most other mammals. Some of the poisons are detoxified <br\/>in the liver. The diet does not provide much energy, but the long periods spent sleeping, along with their relatively <br\/>small brains, help compensate for this (3). There is also evidence that suggests koalas may perform myrecism <br\/>- regurgitating and re-chewing partially digested food, which extracts more energy from the food (7).&nbsp;Both <br\/>males and females reach sexual maturity at around two years old, but males are rarely large enough to compete for <br\/>mating access until four years old.  Females normally give birth to one young every year but in older females this <br\/>may reduce to one every two years. The newborn 'joey' is underdeveloped and crawls rapidly through the mother's <br\/>fur to her pouch, where it suckles for six months. During weaning, in addition to milk, the joey feeds on a substance <br\/>called 'pap' which is a liquefied form of the mother's faeces and provides the joey's digestive system with the <br\/>micro-organisms necessary for digesting the eucalyptus leaves (4). Having first left the pouch during this <br\/>time, the joey rides on its mother's belly, and later rides on her back. It normally remains with its mother until <br\/>the following year's joey has emerged from the pouch (3).

An average cow can consume about <br\/>70kg of grass in an 8 hour day. Cows twist grasses around the tongue and cut them with their lower teeth.  Domestic <br\/>cows are ruminants.  Ruminants have a special system of digestion which allows for the breakdown of the relatively <br\/>indigestible plant material which they consume.  Cows have a four chambered stomach including a rumen, reticulum, <br\/>omasum, and abomasum.  Grass passes through the rumen where it is mixed with specialized bacteria.  From the rumen <br\/>it moves to the reticulum, where it is broken down further.  The partly digested food, known as cud, is regurgitated <br\/>and chewed.  It is then swallowed and moves into the omasum and abomasum, where digestive enzymes break it down <br\/>further and nutrients are absorbed.  The process of digestion takes 70-100 hours, one of the slowest passage rates <br\/>of all animals.  This method of digestion permits ruminants to obtain the most nutrients possible from these plant <br\/>materials.<\/p><p>(Rath 1998; Hindsaw 1993; Walker et al. 1975) <\/p><p><strong>Plant Foods: <\/strong> leaves; <br\/>roots and tubers; wood, bark, or stems<\/p><p><strong>Primary Diet: <\/strong> herbivore  (Folivore )<\/p> "},"flathierarchy":null,"preferredCommonNames":{"vernacularName":"domestic cattle","language":"en","eol_preferred":true},"commonNames":[{"vernacularName":"Free Range Cattle","language":"","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Bovine","language":""},{"vernacularName":"bull","language":""},{"vernacularName":"cow","language":""},{"vernacularName":"domestic cow","language":""},{"vernacularName":"ox","language":""},{"vernacularName":"watusi cattle","language":""},{"vernacularName":"Auerochse","language":"de","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Hausrind","language":"de"},{"vernacularName":"domestic cattle","language":"en","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Aurochs","language":"en"},{"vernacularName":"Brahma cattle","language":"en"},{"vernacularName":"Urus","language":"en"},{"vernacularName":"cattle","language":"en"},{"vernacularName":"domestic cattle (feral)","language":"en"},{"vernacularName":"domestic cattle (ferral)","language":"en"},{"vernacularName":"domesticated cattle","language":"en"},{"vernacularName":"wild auroch","language":"en"},{"vernacularName":"wild ox","language":"en"},{"vernacularName":"zebu cattle","language":"en"},{"vernacularName":"Oeros uitgestorven","language":"nl","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Rund","language":"nl"},{"vernacularName":"Gaa-ay","language":"ur","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Gaan'","language":"ur"},{"vernacularName":"neeli bar Gaa-ay","language":"ur"},{"vernacularName":"sandal bar Gaa-ay","language":"ur"}],"image":{"objectId":"d0bb9002ae5bd125adf6af78c36a2790","identifier":"d0bb9002ae5bd125adf6af78c36a2790","title":"File:BirdsfootTrefoil.jpg","licence":"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/publicdomain\/","rights":null,"credits":"unknown|Author&copy; ","description":null,"mimeType":"jpg","fileName":"d0bb9002ae5bd125adf6af78c36a2790.jpg","URL":"http:\/\/media.eol.org\/content\/2012\/06\/12\/21\/30758_orig.jpg"},"iucnStatus":""}}
