During this time, pandas signal their presence by marking trees and banks with scent <br\/>secreted from glands located beneath the tail (6). They will also strip bark and occasionally males will dust <br\/>bathe; dust particles become covered with the pandas' scent and then waft into the air (6). Males also call during <br\/>this time, and these can be heard echoing through the mountains (7). Females give birth to a single cub that is born <br\/>in an extremely immature stage of development; weighing only a tiny fraction (0.001%) of their mother's weight <br\/>(5). The female cares for her cub in a den located in the base of a hollow tree or in a cave for the first few months of <br\/>its life (4) (8). Young pandas remain dependent on their mother for a year, by which time they are weaned, but usually <br\/>remain with their mothers until they are two years of age and sometimes longer (4) (8). During this time, females <br\/>may leave their cubs to forage for days at a time and in the past these supposedly 'abandoned' cubs were taken into <br\/>captivity (4).&nbsp;Pandas are unusual amongst the larger mammals for the extreme specialisation of their <br\/>diet, which depends almost entirely on bamboo. Bamboo is a relatively abundant food source but has poor nutritional <br\/>value; adults must spend around 14 hours a day feeding (4), and need to consume between 10 and 20 kg over 24 hours <br\/>(8). They therefore alternate periods of feeding and resting throughout the day and night (7). Bamboo is evergreen <br\/>and in winter pandas concentrate on leaves and stems, descending to lower altitudes in search of new shoots in <br\/>spring (6). Despite their specialisation on bamboo, pandas will readily scavenge on meat should they come across <br\/>it (7).

Sloths have long limbs, short bodies, and stumpy tails. Their heads can rotate <br\/>over 90 degrees. Sloths feed mainly on forest canopy leaves, which they digest by bacterial fermentation in a <br\/>many-chambered stomach. Consistent with their reputation, sloths move slowly&mdash;and not much. The single <br\/>young spends 6 to 9 months clinging to its mother, usually to her chest. Although sloths are silent and inconspicuous, <br\/>they are preyed on extensively by eagles and, in some places, Jaguars.<\/p> <br\/><p>The long, coarse hairs of <br\/>sloths have either deep grooves running the length of each hair (two-toed sloths, <em>Choloepus<\/em>) or irregular <br\/>transverse cracks that increase in number and size with age (three-toed sloths, <em>Bradypus<\/em>). A wide <br\/>variety of organisms have been reported to occur both in the grooves and cracks of sloth hairs (including cyanobacteria <br\/>and diatoms) and among their hairs (including moths, beetles, cockroaches, and nematode roundworms). However, <br\/>the greenish color of the hair, which is most evident in three-toed sloths, is due to green algae, which have generally <br\/>been identified as <em>Trichophilus welckeri<\/em>. It is often assumed that the association between three-toed <br\/>sloths and the algae embedded in their hairs is a mutualistic one, with the algae obtaining shelter in the cracks <br\/>of the hair while providing green camouflage for the sloth (it has also has been proposed, however, that the relationship <br\/>may be a commensal one, with the alga offering no benefit to the sloth but simply taking advantage of an available <br\/>habitat).<\/p> <br\/><p>Analyses by Suutari et al. (2010) provided support for the hypothesis that there is a <br\/>specific symbiosis of some sort between sloths and <em>Trichophilus <\/em>green algae. Suutari et al. identified <br\/>three different patterns of algae occurrence in the hair of five sloth species: 1) The green alga in the fur of Brown-throated <br\/>Three-toed Sloths and Pygmy Three-toed Sloths was a unique species and no other green algae were found in their <br\/>fur. Microscopic features of the algae on the hair were consistent with the genus <i>Trichophilus<\/i>. 2)<i> <br\/><\/i>Maned Three-toed Sloths were found to host a variety of algae belonging to genera known to be terrestrial,such <br\/>as <i>Trentepholia <\/i>and <i>Myrmecia<\/i>. 3) Hoffmann's Two-toed Sloths and Pale-throated Three-toed <br\/>Sloths showed both patterns, hosting terrestrial green algae from their surroundings as well as <i>Trichophilus<\/i>. <br\/>Molecular phylogenetic analyses of the <i>Trichophilus <\/i>green algae revealed that those found on&nbsp;Brown-throated <br\/>Three-toed Sloths<i>, <\/i>Pygmy Three-toed Sloths<i> <\/i>and&nbsp;Pale-throated Three-toed Sloths<i> <br\/><\/i>belong to a separate lineage from those occurring on Hoffmann's Two-toed Sloths. Given that Brown-throated <br\/>Three-toed Sloths and Hoffmann's Two-toed Sloths co-occur, this finding suggests evolved specialized associations <br\/>between <i>Trichophilus <\/i>species and different sloth<i> <\/i>species. The three or more <em>Trichophilus<\/em> <br\/>green alga species that have been found only in sloth hair are presumably passed directly from mother to offspring.<\/p> <br\/><br\/><p>In addition to <a href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Primary_producers\u0022>primary producers<\/a> <br\/>(algae), sloth fur also harbors <a href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heterotroph\u0022>heterotrophic<\/a> <br\/>organisms (ciliates, apicomplexans, and dinoflagellates) as well as <a href=\u0022http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Decomposer\u0022>decomposers<\/a> <br\/>(fungi), suggesting that sloth fur supports a versatile microscopic ecosystem.

Each family unit contains around ten individuals (6), led by an old female known as the 'matriarch' <br\/>(2). Family units often join up with other bands of females forming 'kinship groups' or 'bond groups', and larger <br\/>herds may number well over a hundred individuals (7). Male elephants leave their natal group at puberty and tend <br\/>to form much more fluid alliances with other males. Elephants are extremely long-lived and although females <br\/>may reach sexual maturity at ten years old they are at their most fertile between 25 and 45 (2). There is no distinct <br\/>breeding season, although birth peaks in certain areas may relate to the local rainfall patterns (9). Calves <br\/>are born after an exceptionally long gestation period of nearly two years, and continue to be dependent on their <br\/>mother for several years (2). They are also cared for by other females in the group, especially by young females <br\/>known as 'allomothers' (2). The social bonds between elephants are very strong and if faced with danger they will <br\/>form a protective circle around the young calves, with the adults facing outwards and the matriarch adopting <br\/>a threatening pose or even charging the intruder (2). Elephants care for their wounded and also show recognition <br\/>of, and particular interest in, elephant bones (10).&nbsp;Elephant groups will spend the day wandering their <br\/>home range in search of food and water (2). An adult elephant requires 160 kilograms of food a day; using their highly <br\/>mobile trunk they pluck at grasses and leaves or tear at branches and bark with their tusks, which can cause enormous <br\/>damage (7). Elephants can communicate over large distances and use some vocalisations that are below the range <br\/>of human hearing (11).

Much of a koala's time is spent sleeping, and when <br\/>awake they are still a fairly sedentary species. An adult consumes about 500g of fresh leaves per day (3). Koalas <br\/>feed on a variety of trees, but the bulk of their diet comes from only a few eucalypt species (6), with marked local <br\/>and regional differences for the species of eucalypts preferred (5). Eucalyptus leaves are very fibrous and <br\/>highly toxic, but koalas have evolved to cope with these problems with special cheek teeth that grind the leaves <br\/>into a fine paste, which is then digested by microbes in the caecum part of the intestine which is unusually long, <br\/>at around 200cm, and has a blind end, unlike the caecum in most other mammals. Some of the poisons are detoxified <br\/>in the liver. The diet does not provide much energy, but the long periods spent sleeping, along with their relatively <br\/>small brains, help compensate for this (3). There is also evidence that suggests koalas may perform myrecism <br\/>- regurgitating and re-chewing partially digested food, which extracts more energy from the food (7).&nbsp;Both <br\/>males and females reach sexual maturity at around two years old, but males are rarely large enough to compete for <br\/>mating access until four years old.  Females normally give birth to one young every year but in older females this <br\/>may reduce to one every two years. The newborn 'joey' is underdeveloped and crawls rapidly through the mother's <br\/>fur to her pouch, where it suckles for six months. During weaning, in addition to milk, the joey feeds on a substance <br\/>called 'pap' which is a liquefied form of the mother's faeces and provides the joey's digestive system with the <br\/>micro-organisms necessary for digesting the eucalyptus leaves (4). Having first left the pouch during this <br\/>time, the joey rides on its mother's belly, and later rides on her back. It normally remains with its mother until <br\/>the following year's joey has emerged from the pouch (3).

An average cow can consume about <br\/>70kg of grass in an 8 hour day. Cows twist grasses around the tongue and cut them with their lower teeth.  Domestic <br\/>cows are ruminants.  Ruminants have a special system of digestion which allows for the breakdown of the relatively <br\/>indigestible plant material which they consume.  Cows have a four chambered stomach including a rumen, reticulum, <br\/>omasum, and abomasum.  Grass passes through the rumen where it is mixed with specialized bacteria.  From the rumen <br\/>it moves to the reticulum, where it is broken down further.  The partly digested food, known as cud, is regurgitated <br\/>and chewed.  It is then swallowed and moves into the omasum and abomasum, where digestive enzymes break it down <br\/>further and nutrients are absorbed.  The process of digestion takes 70-100 hours, one of the slowest passage rates <br\/>of all animals.  This method of digestion permits ruminants to obtain the most nutrients possible from these plant <br\/>materials.<\/p><p>(Rath 1998; Hindsaw 1993; Walker et al. 1975) <\/p><p><strong>Plant Foods: <\/strong> leaves;
