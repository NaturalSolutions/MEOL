This <br\/>primate is deemed chiefly terrestrial, but also exhibits  arboreal traits. Its habitat is threatened by expansion <br\/>of oil palm  plantations which have been created in prior lowland rainforests; slash  and burn practices, especially <br\/>in Indonesian Borneo have also destroyed  and fragmented considerable habitat area. <font color=\u0022#000000\u0022><font <br\/>class=\u0022text12ari\u0022> Colouration is a light  brown, with even lighter undersides, the tail and elongated muzzle <br\/>being  nearly hairless (Cawthon Lang. 2009) The common name is associated with the  trait of this primate's tail <br\/>held in a semi-erect fashion, much like the  nature of a pig's tail. <\/font><\/font><\/font><\/font><\/p> <br\/><p><font <br\/>color=\u0022#000000\u0022><font class=\u0022text12ari\u0022><i>M. nemestrina<\/i>  occurs in Malaysia (including the Malay <br\/>Peninsula and Sabah and Sarawak  Borneo), Indonesia (Bangka, Kalimantan Borneo and Sumatra), Brunei as  well <br\/>as southern peninsular Thailand.

(Groves. 2001)  <i>M. nemestrina<\/i> is known to hybridize with its close relative <i>M. <br\/>leonine<\/i>  in southern peninsular Thailand and on the islands of  Yao Yai and  Phuket.

(Laska. 2001)   Lifespan in the wild is on the order of three decades. <br\/>The species is considered polygynandrous, with mating occurring  virtually throughout the year.  A female typically <br\/>gives birth to a  single infant subsequent to a gestation interval ranging from 23 to 26  weeks. The offspring are <br\/>nursed for a period of 35 to 52 weeks.

In addition <br\/>to habitat  loss, the species has been systematically persecuted by farmers, who  consider this primate as a cause <br\/>for certain crop predation.

In summer, this species has a black head, gray body, and light gray wings that, unlike <br\/>those of the similarly-patterned Laughing Gull (<em>Leucophaeus atricilla<\/em>), have white leading edges <br\/>and black tips. In winter, this species becomes white-headed except for a small black spot behind the eye. Male <br\/>and female Bonaparte\u2019s Gulls are similar to one another in all seasons. Bonaparte\u2019s Gull breeds over a wide <br\/>area of southern Alaska and Canada east to Quebec. However, despite its large breeding territory, this species <br\/>nests only locally within its breeding range. In winter, Bonaparte\u2019s Gulls migrate south to the southern Great <br\/>Lakes and coastal areas of the U.S.south to central Mexico. In summer, Bonaparte\u2019s Gulls breed along open edges <br\/>of northern evergreen forests near water, being among the only gulls to nest in trees. In winter, this species <br\/>may be found along large bodies of fresh or salt water, including on riverbanks, sandy beaches, and the open ocean. <br\/>Bonaparte\u2019s Gull eats small fish at all seasons, but this species also eats insects while further inland in <br\/>summer. Due to the relative inaccessibility of this species\u2019 breeding grounds, most birdwatchers only observe <br\/>Bonaparte\u2019s Gulls during winter, when they are relatively common along the coasts. At this time of year, this <br\/>species is most easily observed plunging into the water to catch small fish. Bonaparte\u2019s Gull is most active <br\/>during the day.<\/p><p><a href='http:\/\/www.iucnredlist.org\/apps\/redlist\/details\/106003242\/0'>Threat <br\/>Status: Least concern<\/a><\/p> "},"flathierarchy":null,"preferredCommonNames":{"vernacularName":"Bonaparte's Gull","language":"en","eol_preferred":true},"commonNames":[{"vernacularName":"Gaviota-de-Bonaparte","language":"","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Gavina de Bonaparte","language":"ca","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Racek Bonapart\u016fv","language":"cs","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Racek Bonapartuv","language":"cs"},{"vernacularName":"racek Bonapart\u00f9v","language":"cs"},{"vernacularName":"gwylan Bonaparte","language":"cy","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Bonapartem\u00e5ge","language":"da","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Bonapartem\u00f6we","language":"de","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Bonaparte-M\u00f6we","language":"de"},{"vernacularName":"Bonaparte's Gull","language":"en","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Bonaparte's rosy gull","language":"en"},{"vernacularName":"Bonaparte\u00ccs Gull","language":"en"},{"vernacularName":"Bonaparte\u2019s Gull","language":"en"},{"vernacularName":"black-headed gull","language":"en"},{"vernacularName":"sea pigeon","language":"en"},{"vernacularName":"Gaviota de Bonaparte","language":"es","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Galleguito Chico","language":"es"},{"vernacularName":"kuusekajakas","language":"et","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Gavina de Bonaparte","language":"eu","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Kuusilokki","language":"fi","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Hattarm\u00e1si","language":"fo","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"mouette de bonaparte","language":"fr","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Sl\u00e9ibh\u00edn Bonaparte","language":"ga","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Gavina de Bonaparte","language":"gl","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Gaivota de Bonaparte","language":"gl"},{"vernacularName":"\u05e9\u05d7\u05e3 \u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05e7\u05d0\u05d9","language":"he","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"M\u00f2v janm w\u00f2z","language":"ht","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Trj\u00e1m\u00e1fur","language":"is","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Gabbiano di Bonaparte","language":"it","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"\u30dc\u30ca\u30d1\u30eb\u30c8\u30ab\u30e2\u30e1","language":"ja","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Bonaparuto-kamome","language":"ja"},{"vernacularName":"bonaparutokamome","language":"ja"},{"vernacularName":"Bonaparto kiras","language":"lt","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Juodasnapis kiras","language":"lt"},{"vernacularName":"Kleine Kokmeeuw","language":"nl","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Kanadisk hettem\u00e5ke","language":"no","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Kanadahettem\u00e5ke","language":"no"},{"vernacularName":"\u1405\u148b \u1472\u152d\u1511\u144a","language":"oj","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Mewa kanadyjska","language":"pl","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"\u0447\u0430\u0439\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430","language":"ru","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"\u0411\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0447\u0430\u0439\u043a\u0430","language":"ru"},{"vernacularName":"\u0427\u0430\u0439\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430","language":"ru"},{"vernacularName":"\u010cajka \u010diernozob\u00e1","language":"sk","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"cajka ciernozob\u00e1","language":"sk"},{"vernacularName":"\u010dajka Bonapartova","language":"sk"},{"vernacularName":"ameri\u0161ki re\u010dni galeb","language":"sl","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"bonapartov galeb","language":"sl"},{"vernacularName":"Tr\u00e4dm\u00e5s","language":"sv","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"bonaparte mart\u0131s\u0131","language":"tr","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Karaba\u015f Mart\u0131","language":"tr"},{"vernacularName":"\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d \u0411\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0456\u0432","language":"uk","eol_preferred":true}],"image":{"objectId":"0b34811636337d7648ab065852dfda99","identifier":"0b34811636337d7648ab065852dfda99","title":"Chroicocephalus philadelphia (Bonaparte's Gull) - Juvenile","licence":"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/2.0\/","rights":null,"credits":"<a href='http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/32005048@N06'>Arthur Chapman<\/a>&copy;

Breeding is restricted to one litter annually per pack, born to the alpha female, <br\/>while other pack members help care for the young of the dominant pair. The dominant female will kill the pups of <br\/>any other females in the pack (2).&nbsp;In Australia, dingoes breed from March to April; in Southeast Asia they <br\/>mate from August to September (3). Gestation lasts 61 to 69 days, with an average litter size of one to ten individuals <br\/>(2). Female pack members help the mother rear, and even suckle, the pups, and both male and female pack members <br\/>help feed the young by regurgitating food and water for the pups (5), which usually become independent at three <br\/>to six months (2).  Female dingoes generally become sexually mature at nine to twelve months old, but do not start <br\/>breeding until two years of age, while males reach full sexual maturity between one and three years of age (5). <br\/> Dingoes live for up to seven or eight years in the wild and up to 13 years in captivity (2).&nbsp;The dingo is an opportunistic <br\/>hunter and will hunt small prey alone, such as rabbits, rodents, birds and lizards (2) (3).

It has been reported to 3,000 m asl in the Ethiopian highlands <br\/>(Yalden <em>et al.<\/em> 1996).

At the beginning of the 20th century, <br\/>it was also present in the north-western part of the Iberian Peninsula (Delibes 1999).

The tiger population was estimated at 400-500 <br\/>in the first and second national tiger action plans (Govt of Indonesia 1994, 2007a), and at 342-509 in six major <br\/>protected areas (estimates from Shepherd and Magnus 2004). However, incorporating more recent research, covering <br\/>most of tiger estimated habitat (Sanderson <em>et al<\/em>. 2006) suggests the population could be higher (see <br\/>Table 1 in attached PDF).<br\/><br\/>There is no recent information from Berbak or Gunung Leuser, and both of these <br\/>estimates are considered speculative. Completion of a research in the three Tiger Conservation Landscapes <br\/>in Riau province by Sunarto <em>et al<\/em>. (2007) will improve efforts to assess the Sumatran tiger population. <br\/><br\/><br\/>IUCN Guidelines (IUCN 2006) define population as the number of mature individuals, defined as \u201cindividuals <br\/>known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction.\u201d While in general this refers to all reproductive-age <br\/>adults in the population, the Guidelines also \u201cstress that the intention of the definition of mature individuals <br\/>is to allow the estimate of the number of mature individuals to take account of all the factors that may make a taxon <br\/>more vulnerable than otherwise might be expected.\u201d Two factors which increase the tiger's vulnerability <br\/>to extinction are their low densities (relative to other mammals, including their prey species) and relatively <br\/>low recruitment rates (where few animals raise offspring which survive to join the breeding population) (Smith <br\/>and McDougal 1991, Kerley <em>et al<\/em>. 2003). Low densities means that relatively large areas are required <br\/>for conservation of viable populations; it has long been recognized that many protected areas are too small to <br\/>conserve viable tiger populations (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Dinerstein <em>et al<\/em>. 1997, Sanderson <em>et <br\/>al<\/em>. 2006). Low recruitment rates also require larger populations and larger areas to conserve viable populations, <br\/>as well as mortality reduction in non-protected areas to maintain population size through connectivity (Carroll <br\/>and Miquelle 2006). High mortality rates can be offset by an abundant prey base (Karanth <em>et al<\/em>. 2006), <br\/>but prey base depletion was considered a leading threat to tigers across much of their range (Sanderson <em>et <br\/>al<\/em>. 2006). The IUCN Guidelines advise that \u201cmature individuals that will never produce new recruits <br\/>should not be counted.\u201d Low recruitment rates indicate that fewer adults than would be expected produce new <br\/>recruits. Defining population size as the total estimated number of reproductive age adults in the taxon would <br\/>also not take into account that many occur in subpopulations which are too small or too threatened for long-term <br\/>viability. Instead, the number of mature individuals is defined as equivalent to the estimated effective population <br\/>size. <br\/><br\/>Effective population size (Ne) is an estimator of the genetic size of the population, and is <br\/>generally considered representative of the proportion of the total adult population (N) which reproduces itself <br\/>through offspring which themselves survive and reproduce. Ne is usually smaller than N, as has been documented <br\/>for the tiger. The effective population size of tigers in Nepal\u2019s Chitwan National Park was equivalent to just <br\/>40% of the actual adult population (Smith and McDougal 1991). Therefore, the number of viable mature Sumatran <br\/>tigers is projected to be 40% of the total estimated population, in the range of 176 - 271 (based on the detailed <br\/>figures given above), with no subpopulation having an effective population size larger than 50, following the <br\/>precautionary principle in selecting the lower bound subpopulation sizes for Kerinci Seblat, Gunung Leuser <br\/>and Bukit Tigapuluh. <br\/><br\/>The Sumatran tiger is declining due to high rates of habitat loss (3.2-5.9%\/yr; <br\/>Achard <em>et al<\/em>. 2002, FWI\/GFW 2001, Uryu <em>et al<\/em>. 2007) and fragmentation, which also occur, <br\/>to a lesser extent, inside protected areas (Gaveau <em>et al<\/em>. 2007, Kinnaird <em>et al<\/em>. 2003, Linkie <br\/><em>et al<\/em>. 2003, 2004, 2006). There are high levels of human-tiger conflict (Nyhus and Tilson 2004, Browne <br\/>and Martyr 2007), as well as illegal trade in tiger parts (Nowell 2000, Nowell 2007). From 1998-2002 at least 51 <br\/>tigers per year were killed, with 76% for purposes of trade and 15% out of human-tiger conflict (Shepherd and Magnus <br\/>2004). Ng and Nemora (2007) found the parts of at least 23 tigers for sale in market surveys around the island.<\/div> <br\/><br\/><b>History<\/b><br\/> <ul id=\u0022assessment_years\u0022><li class=\u0022assessment_year\u0022> <div class=\u0022year\u0022>1996<\/div> <br\/><div class=\u0022category\u0022>Critically Endangered<\/div> <div class=\u0022source\u0022>(Baillie and Groombridge 1996)<\/div> <br\/><\/li> <li class=\u0022assessment_year\u0022> <div class=\u0022year\u0022>1996<\/div> <div class=\u0022category\u0022>Critically Endangered<\/div> <br\/><\/li> <\/ul> "},"flathierarchy":null,"preferredCommonNames":{"vernacularName":"Sumatran tiger","language":"en","eol_preferred":true},"commonNames":[{"vernacularName":"Sumatran tiger","language":"en","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Tigre di Sumatra","language":"it","eol_preferred":true}],"image":{"objectId":"6af6ebaa609ad61dcd150a9e931e853f","identifier":"6af6ebaa609ad61dcd150a9e931e853f","title":"File:Tiger - melbourne zoo.jpg","licence":"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-sa\/3.0\/","rights":null,"credits":"<a href='http:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/User:Fir0002'>Fir0002<\/a>&copy; ","description":null,"mimeType":"jpg","fileName":"6af6ebaa609ad61dcd150a9e931e853f.jpg","URL":"http:\/\/media.eol.org\/content\/2012\/06\/12\/20\/73431_orig.jpg"},"iucnStatus":""},"48134919":{"collectionid":13207,"pageid":308378,"taxonConceptId":48134919,"taxonName":"Giraffa camelopardalis","textDesc":{"objectId":"cc0fef3d081dd1a5fcd49a569984268f","identifier":"cc0fef3d081dd1a5fcd49a569984268f","title":"Description","licence":"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/","rights":"Copyright Wildscreen 2003-2008","credits":"&copy; Wildscreen","description":"Spectacularly tall, the giraffe has a very long neck with a short, upstanding mane, and high shoulders that slope <br\/>steeply to the hindquarters.

They are largely solitary (2) <br\/>and though once thought to be nocturnal (6), are now known to be active during the day (2). They feed largely on leaves, <br\/>grasses, fruits and fungi, some of which are known to be poisonous. It has been suggested that this is why okapis <br\/>eat charcoal from burned forest trees, as is evidenced from their dung (2). Carbon, in the form of charcoal, is <br\/>an excellent antidote for toxin ingestion and recent observations in Zanzibar found red colobus monkeys eating <br\/>charcoal from native cooking fires and kilns (7). It is also known that many other animals find sources of kaolin, <br\/>a type of clay, to offset the effects of poisonous leaves and fruit in their diet.&nbsp;Male and female okapi live <br\/>in home ranges, but they are not territorial and these ranges overlap (3). From observations on captive animals, <br\/>it appears that male okapis mark their ranges with urine, by crossing their front legs, urinating on them, and <br\/>then walking through their range. They will also urinate directly onto plants. Both males and females rub their <br\/>necks against tree trunks (3).&nbsp;Mothers will not stray very far after giving birth, so the young okapi will <br\/>remain close by until at least a few days old, in what is known as a 'follower phase' (3). It then becomes a 'nester' <br\/>for a number of months, in which it lies in vegetation. During this intensive nesting phase, the calf is extremely <br\/>efficient in the use of energy, primarily only nursing or sleeping. Towards the end of the intensive nesting phase, <br\/>the calf can maintain its temperature properly, and so activates its rumens, and defecates for the first time <br\/>(3). This is thought to be a defence against predators (2). Okapi mothers use infrasonic communication to communicate <br\/>with their calves. This is sound that is below the range of human hearing \u2013 also used by elephants (3).&nbsp;The <br\/>young are weaned at six months old although they may continue to take milk for some time afterwards. The males begin <br\/>developing their horns at about one year and reach their adult size at the age of three. They are believed to reach <br\/>sexual maturity around two years old (2). Captive individuals have been known to live for up to 33 years (3).
