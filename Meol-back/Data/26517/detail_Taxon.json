It emerges from <br\/>its night-time shelter and basks for some time in the sun before commencing its search for food (2).  This semi-aquatic <br\/>turtle forages both on land and underwater (2).   Its highly varied and omnivorous diet consists primarily of insects, <br\/>such as beetles, millipedes, dragonflies, and ants, but it also feeds on snails, slugs, earthworms and spiders <br\/>(5), and even frogs, nestling birds, mice and voles.  Berries, seeds, and other plant parts comprise the vegetarian <br\/>part of its diet (2).&nbsp;Mating takes place from March until June, and begins with a male searching out a female, <br\/>identifying her sex by using sight and smell.  Whilst circling the female, the male probes her tail and cloacal <br\/>area with his nose, and may bite at her head and neck.  The female may move away, resulting in a chase, with the male <br\/>biting at her legs and head to stop her.   Finally, the male will mount the female, accompanied by more bites to the <br\/>head and neck, and mating lasts for 5 to 20 minutes (2).&nbsp;The bog turtle lays eggs in June and July (2), usually <br\/>in the late afternoon or early evening (5).  The single clutch of one to six white eggs are laid either into a cavity <br\/>dug by the female, or under moss or grass tussocks (2).  The eggs hatch in August or September, and while most hatchlings <br\/>emerge from the nest immediately, some may remain in the nest over winter (2).  Both the eggs and hatchlings are <br\/>preyed upon by a number of birds and mammals, including foxes, raccoons, and opossum (4).&nbsp;In October (4), <br\/>the bog turtle retreats into areas of dense vegetation to hibernate (5).  Resting in soft mud, often just below <br\/>a frozen surface, in the old burrow of a muskrat or meadow vole, amongst rocks, roots or under vegetation (5), the <br\/>bog turtle will remain in hibernation until April (4).  As well as burrowing for hibernation, this proficient <br\/>digger will quickly burrow into the muddy ground whenever it is alarmed (2).

Mating tends to <br\/>occur just offshore of the nesting beaches; using a curved claw on each front flipper and a flat nail at the end of <br\/>the tail, males are able to grip their mates (2). Females haul out onto the beach at night and dig large nests with <br\/>their back flippers beyond the high tide mark, they typically lay between 100 and 150 eggs in one nest and then proceed <br\/>to cover the eggs with sand; the whole process takes around two hours (6). A single female returns to breed only <br\/>once every two to five years but will lay up to nine nests in that one season (2). Incubation takes between 45 and <br\/>70 days, and temperature has been shown to determine of the sex of hatchlings; with females being produced at warmer <br\/>temperatures (6). Breaking open their eggs with a special hooked 'egg tooth' that will subsequently be lost; <br\/>hatchlings use their powerful front flippers to reach the surface, and then proceed to the sea (7).  The soft-bodied <br\/>juveniles are particularly vulnerable at this time from a variety of predators, such as ghost crabs and gulls <br\/>on the beach to sharks and dolphins in the water (7).&nbsp;Unlike other marine turtles, adult green turtles are <br\/>almost exclusively herbivorous, grazing on seagrasses and algae (8); it is assumed that juveniles are more omnivorous <br\/>although the exact composition of their diet is unknown (6) "},"flathierarchy":[{"sourceIdentifier":"4460463","taxonID":48135304,"parentNameUsageID":48135303,"taxonConceptID":454546,"scientificName":"Chelonia mydas Linnaeus 1758","taxonRank":"Species","type":"leaf"}],"preferredCommonNames":{"vernacularName":"Green Turtle","language":"en","eol_preferred":true},"commonNames":[{"vernacularName":"green seaturtle","language":"","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"greenturtle","language":""},{"vernacularName":"\u0633\u0644\u062d\u0641\u0627\u0629 \u0628\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u062e\u0636\u0631\u0627\u0621","language":"ar","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"\u0417\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0430","language":"bg","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"zelen\u0430 morsk\u0430 kostenurk\u0430","language":"bg"},{"vernacularName":"crwban m\u00f4r gwyrdd","language":"cy","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Suppenschildkr\u00f6te","language":"de","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Suppenschildkrote","language":"de"},{"vernacularName":"\u03a0\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7 \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u03c7\u03b5\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1","language":"el","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Green Turtle","language":"en","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Common Green Turtle","language":"en"},{"vernacularName":"Eastern Pacific green turtle","language":"en"},{"vernacularName":"common green sea turtle","language":"en"},{"vernacularName":"green sea turtle","language":"en"},{"vernacularName":"Tortuga verde","language":"es","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Tortuga blanca","language":"es"},{"vernacularName":"Tortuga prieta","language":"es"},{"vernacularName":"Tortuga-marina verde-del Atl\u00e1ntico","language":"es"},{"vernacularName":"Tortue verte du Pacifique est","language":"fr","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Tortue comestible","language":"fr"},{"vernacularName":"Tortue franche","language":"fr"},{"vernacularName":"Tortue verte","language":"fr"},{"vernacularName":"\u05e6\u05d1-\u05d9\u05dd \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e7","language":"he","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Tartaruga verde","language":"it","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"\u30a2\u30aa\u30a6\u30df\u30ac\u30e1","language":"ja","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"\u017daliasis v\u0117\u017elys","language":"lt","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"groene zeeschildpad","language":"nl","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"soepschildpad","language":"nl"},{"vernacularName":"\u017c\u00f3\u0142w zielony","language":"pl","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"\u017c\u00f3\u0142w jadalny","language":"pl"},{"vernacularName":"\u0417\u0435\u043b\u0451\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0430\u0445\u0430","language":"ru","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"\u0427\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0430\u0445\u0430 \u0437\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f","language":"ru"},{"vernacularName":"Orja\u0161ka \u010drepaha","language":"sl","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"breshka e gjelb\u00ebrt e detit","language":"sq","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Ye\u015fil kaplumba\u011fa","language":"tr","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"Yesil kaplumbaga","language":"tr"},{"vernacularName":"ye\u015fil deniz kaplumba\u011fas\u0131","language":"tr"},{"vernacularName":"\u0427\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0430\u0445\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0437\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430","language":"uk","eol_preferred":true},{"vernacularName":"\u0417\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0430\u0445\u0430","language":"uk"}],"image":{"objectId":"1d76517f01a6b6479d04b526104d122f","identifier":"1d76517f01a6b6479d04b526104d122f","title":"File:Green turtle John Pennekamp.jpg","licence":"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-sa\/3.0\/","rights":null,"credits":"<a href='http:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/User:Dschwen'>Daniel Schwen<\/a>&copy;

Although adults feed primarily on fish, juvenile gharials sustain <br\/>themselves on a vast array of invertebrates (5).&nbsp;Adult females, which reach maturity and become sexually <br\/>receptive at around ten years old, are defended in harems by individual males (5). Although its precise function <br\/>is poorly understood, it is thought that the male's bulbous ghara may be a visual sex indicator, sound resonator <br\/>or bubbling device utilised during courtship (6). Nesting occurs during the dry season when the females drag <br\/>themselves onto dry land to excavate holes into which around 40 large eggs are buried (2) (5). The eggs are naturally <br\/>incubated in the nest hole but the female remains near the nest to guard it from  predators such as pigs, jackals, <br\/>lizards and mongooses,. After around 70 days when the hatchlings are ready to emerge, they call out from inside <br\/>the eggs, alerting the mother to dig the eggs out of the nest hole.

This hybridisation appears to be natural but may pose a threat to <br\/>the genetic purity of this species if population numbers fall. The changing nesting strategies may reflect evidence <br\/>of hybridisation (5).&nbsp;Cuban crocodiles have broad back teeth that are adapted to crushing turtle shells, <br\/>which enables these crocodiles to get to their main source of food (6). Fish and mammals are also consumed and historically <br\/>this species appears to have preyed on the, now extinct, giant sloth (6). Possessing strong hind legs, this crocodilian <br\/>is particularly agile on land, able to move quickly and leap into the air (6).
